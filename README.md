# shibboleth-idp-dockerized
A Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP) base-image

The image is almost ready for prime time, but a few things needs to be tightened up before the initial push to `master`. Check out the `build-up` branch to see the current state of the project.

The `build-up` image is available on the Docker Hub for testing at https://hub.docker.com/r/unicon/shibboleth-idp.
